Hey again,

You probably feel a little different. Hopefully good different! I dunno, I'm not you. Not anymore.

You're probably looking at your stats, your empty coffers, and you're wondering where to go from here.

Well, it's time to start again.

* Get a head-start on things by running start-again.js, which automates some of the advice below.
* Get access to servers by running do-nuke.js.
    * When choosing a target, look at the maximum money that server can hold, but also consider server 
    growth property. If you can get a server to its maximum quickly, that's really good coin on 
    subsequent hacks.
    * Use what-about.js to find additional targets.
* Start a cycle of growing the money on a server and hacking it, using grow-n-hack.js. Target a few 
servers. Even if you don't get a lot of money right away, you can level your Hack skill pretty quickly.
* Weaken a server's security level by running weaken.js. Multiple threads -> more effectiveness. This
is also good for leveling Hack.
    * Look for servers with lots of RAM and use them to run weaken.js in concentrated attacks on 
    high-security servers.
    * Servers with high RAM:
        * zer0
        * avmnite-2h
        * silver-helix
        * omega-net
* Create groups of servers that weaken and hack each other. Use establish-cohort.js (aliased to 
"establish") to get the cohort started.
    * It's helpful to use aliases to keep track of which servers belong to which cohort. The "global" 
    option will give you tab completion for a cohort's name. This is especially useful in combination 
    with what-about.js.
* Buy a Hacknet instance or two, to passively earn you some money. Level 'em when you can.
* If you’ve got money coming in at a good clip, buy a TOR router from Alpha Enterprises ASAP. That will 
give you access to the dark web.
    * With the dark web accessible, you can start buying programs to open ports and hack more servers.
    * If you have no augmentations, save your money and write the programs yourself. It’s also a good 
    way to level Intelligence!
* Travel to Volhaven, Ishima, or Aevum for servers in a wide selection of sizes.
* Joining a regional faction *may* prevent you from joining other regional factions.
* If you’ve installed an augmentation or two, aim for the Neuroreceptor Management Implant, which 
removes the penalty for not focusing on a task. It’s exclusive to the Tian Di Hui faction and costs 
$1.10b with no multiplier, plus 75k faction reputation.
    * Tian Di Hui also offers a lot of augmentations for boosting your Charisma and reputation gain, 
    which can speed up the process of getting access to other augmentations.

Best of luck. Not that you need it.
