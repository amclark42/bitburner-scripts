Hey again,

You probably feel a little different. Hopefully good different! I dunno, I'm not you. Not anymore.

You're probably looking at your stats, your empty coffers, and you're wondering where to go from here.

Well, it's time to start again.

* Get access to servers by running do-nuke.js. Start with n00dles.
    * When choosing a target, look at the maximum money that server can hold, but also consider server 
    growth property. If you can get a server to its maximum quickly, that's really good coin on 
    subsequent hacks.
    * Use what-about.js to find additional targets.
* Start a cycle of growing the money on a server and hacking it, using grow-n-hack.js. Target a few 
servers. Even if you don't get a lot of money right away, you can level your Hack skill pretty quickly.
* Weaken a server's security level by running weaken.js. Multiple threads -> more effectiveness. This
is also good for leveling Hack.
    * Look for servers with lots of RAM and use them to run weaken.js in concentrated attacks on 
    high-security servers.
    * Servers with high RAM:
        * zer0
        * avmnite-2h
        * silver-helix
        * omega-net
* Buy a Hacknet instance or two, to passively earn you some money. Level 'em when you can.
* As soon as you can, buy a TOR router from Alpha Enterprises. That will give you access to the dark 
web.
* With the dark web accessible, you can start buying programs to open ports and hack more servers.
* As starter jobs go, FoodNStuff isn't bad. You can level your STR/DEF/DEX/AGI a bit, and your CHA 
a bunch.
* Alpha Enterprises has a Software Engineering Intern position. It requires 100 Hacking, and you'll 
have to work for 8 hours straight for maximum reputation. But it'll raise your Hack and CHA, get you
some good coin, and after 1 day's work you can apply for the next level Software position.
* Joining a city's faction will likely prevent you from joining other city factions.

Best of luck. Not that you need it.
